DocFetch is a helper which somehow i believe we all may require 
as mainly it helps us to find a file in our system when it is difficult for us to remember the path
we have tested it multiple times till now and we find it working correctly , please try and let us know about your experience.

we have use Python in it mainly because it is easier with python to interact with OS , there can be other ways too for doing the 
same thing but since python was known to me for this only from a joke (you all must have seen that on instagram) so picked it.

Till now i haven't attach the react and python file so that they can work together this is out just for a testing purpose , we will
made some updates and changes according to the responses we will be receiving .
THANKYOU :)
